# API Implementation and Reuse

TIBCO Cloud Integration allows an organization to implement an API Led development (following the Gartner Bi-Modal architecture principle) in very easy steps.  

For implementing the API spec lets start with a connection creation needed for the app. Navigate to "Integration Apps" from menu as below:

## Creating a connection to CRM DB
**Let's create a Connection which will be used to develop our integration app.**

Please get the connection details from the file - 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git-akurian/TIBCO-Cloud-Integration-Virtual-Workshop/master/labfiles/flogoapp/crmdbconnection.md'

From the Menu Choose Connections > then add connection > enter mysql to find connector :

Clicking on Connection and enter the details given by your instructor > Hit Connect :

A connection will be successfully added as below:

## Creating an App (A Microservice)

With API Specification created and mocked-up, we are ready to build the actual service based on the specification.

For this workshop, we will use 'Flogo', a lightweight integration tool available in TCI, to build a microservice from the API Spec.

There are many ways to navigate to Flogo -
a) Switch to "Apps" from the menu and hit "Create/Import" button > Select Flogo > "Create New App"

Change the name to "ShipmentWaiverApp" and hit Create

### Flogo Application Initial Steps
From the main API Specs page, under the group you created, you should see your API specification. When you highlight your application you will see three vertical dots on the right, you can click on the dots to select “Create Flogo app”, as shown below .

For this workshop we will use the Default information provided. You can also rename your application, or keep the name that was automatically generated.
Finally click on “Create” to automatically generate a Flogo app for your API specification.

After waiting few seconds , As illustrated below, TCI automatically created a flow for the POST method you designed. We can now configure this flow, and add additional steps as required.
Click on the flow to edit it :

Notice that a trigger and an activity have been created for you:

### How to map fields and add activities in a Flogo App

**This is also referred to as 'Orchestrating and Transforming' the microservice flow**

We will now need to map the inputs to the outputs.  First click on the trigger and change the port number & save
<img src="/images/apiimp/6.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

We will map the following on Map to Flow Inputs: Note you can simply click on the elements or type them out as shown below and Save

<img src="/images/apiimp/7.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>


Lastly we will map the following to Map to Flow Outputs. Note you can simply click on the elements or type them out as shown below and Save.

<img src="/images/apiimp/8.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

You can use a simple click and drag to move the activities within the flow, this will allow you to add new activities in order to build a complete end-to-end process. For this workshop we will be calling existing RESTful API to get a new transaction ID, extract customer and product information, log a message into the application log, and implement the response sent back to the user.


### Adding a FetchCustomerDetails Activity  

Now, let’s start configuring the process API to achieve an orchestration of services..

Click on the return activity, and drag it a few of places to the right as illustrated below :
<img src="/images/apiimp/10.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Note: Everything you do here is automatically saved.

Then click on the first orange box, find the "MySQL" options, and select the ‘MySQL Query’ activity.
Also rename that activity as FetchCustomerDetails by clicking on the pencil icon and under settings choose the connection we created earlier and save it  :

<img src="/images/apiimp/14.png" alt="add MySQL" width=700/>

Click on the input settings and enter the sql statement as shown below :
<img src="/images/apiimp/15.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Click next on the input and create input mapping as below and hit save.
<img src="/images/apiimp/16.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Your "FetchCustomerDetails" activity is now completely configured.


We will also add "Log Message" activity to log the output of FetchCustomerDetails .  click on the next orange box and configure as below :

<img src="/images/apiimp/17.png" alt="Create App" width=700/>

The following activities for the Process APP can be build the same way.
When we are finished the completed process orchestration will look similar to the one below.
