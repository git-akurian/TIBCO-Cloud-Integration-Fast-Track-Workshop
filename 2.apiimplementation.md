# API Implementation and Reuse

## Overview
In this hands-on lab you will extend itineraries API implementation by reusing **aircrafts API**.  The current itineraries API responds with reservation, passenger, flight and status details.  We want to also include aircraft details.  

### Get Started

Start by signing into TIBCO Cloud and opening Flogo.  There are many ways to navigate to Flogo but let’s start with this.

1)	Start at Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud.
2)	Select Integration.
3)	Select Flogo.

### Import Application

We are going to use a prebuilt application for this hands-on lab and extend it by reusing flights API. 

1)	Select Create.
2)	Give your new app a name, **v1_itineraries_todo** and select create.
3)	Select Create a TIBCO Flogo App.
4)	Select **+ Import app**.
5)	Navigate to where you extracted the connected customer experience artifacts and choose or drag **CustomerExperienceAirport/TCI/v1_itineraries_todo.json** into upload files and select Upload.
  Or redownload the [v1_itineraries_todo.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkarasz/keys2cloud2019/master/project/apispecs/TCI/Itineraries_lab/v1_itineraries_todo.json) (tip: ctrl+click and save file)
6)	Press continue when you get the warning dialog for passwords.
7)	You are now ready to extend this API with aircraft details.
  
### Extend and Reuse API

Let’s extend the **itineraries API** to include aircrafts details.

1)	Select **V1Itineraries_reservationid_GET**.  GET /itineraries/{reservationid} implementation will be opened.  Here you see the orchestration that invokes **reservations**, **passengers**, **flights**, and **statuses** APIs.  You are now going invoke an API call to **aircrafts** in the next steps.
2)	Hover your mouse over the gray line and select the **+** to add a new activity.
3)	From Add Activity, scroll down, select General, select Invoke REST Service. 
4)	Drag the InvokeRESTService to the right of Status.
5)	Now let’s configure the Invoke Rest Service activity.  
6)	Let’s rename this activity.  Select InvokeRESTService, hover your mouse over the name InvokeRESTService and select the edit icon.  
7)	Rename **InvokeRESTService** to **Aircraft**.
8)  Select **Settings** and paste the following URL in URL field.
  `https://integration.cloud.tibcoapps.com:443/wz3dr4zotkxmqg5au6yhc526iw2otlc2/v1/aircrafts/{aircraftid}`
9)  Now let’s map activity input.  Select **Input**, expand pathParams and select aircraftid.   Expand Upstream Output->Reservation->responseBody->reservation and select aircraftid.
10) Configure the Output settings.  Select **Output Settings** and paste the following schema into Response Schema.
```
{"aircraft":
    {"aircraftid":"111",
    "type":"767",
    "seatcapacity":"280"}
}
```
11) Let’s map the aircraft details into the Return activity.  Select Return activity, expand Flow Outputs itinerary and select aircraft.  In upstream Output Aircraft, expand Aircraft->responseBody, select aircraft.
  
### Start Testing

In this section we will test **itineraries API** implementation.

1)	Select Start testing.
2)	Select Create a Launch Configuration.
3)	Expand Activity Input flowInputs->pathParams->reservationid.  And enter ‘AAAAA11111’ into flowInputs.  Use quotes.  Select Next. Select Run.
4)	Your Testing is complete.  Scroll down to see the response and confirm that aircraft details were added to the response.
5)	Select Stop Testing. Cancel. 
  
### Push App

In this section we are going to push the itineraries app to the cloud and test the live endpoints.

1)	Select Push app.
2)	The itineraries app with be pushed to the cloud and you will see a progress bar and a completion message.
3)	Test your live endpoint by selecting Endpoint, select View and Test.
4)	Enter AAAAA11111 for reserverationid input parameter and select Try it out!
  
### Summary
In this exercise you imported an application and extended by reusing **aircrafts API**.  You performed a local test and pushed the application to the cloud.  You finshed by testing the application's live endpoints.
