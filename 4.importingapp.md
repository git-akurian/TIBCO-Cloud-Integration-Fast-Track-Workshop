Congratulations! Your app is now fully configured and published for anyone to test and use.
**Let's start testing the completed app.**

### Testing

In this section we will test the **Shipment Waiver API** implementation.

1.	Select Endpoint to open and hit Start testing.

3.	Expand Activity Input flowInputs -> Customer -> loginId.  Enter ‘EmailID’ into flowInputs.  Use double quotes "". *(This is because we have defined the emailid field as type string)*

Note : Enter your own email id Or use "johndoe@tibco.com" which is in the sample.

### Summary
In this exercise, you imported an application and extended it by reusing **Shipment Waiver API**.   You performed a local test to make sure your process app is able to connect to all distinct systems and is ready to be pushed further and be available for wider usage.
