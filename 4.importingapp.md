8. In order to correct the error on fetch customer details activity, We have to correct the db connection imported with the application.  Open and edit the connection as below

and check the host & password details previously shared for the "CRMDB" and hit Connect.

Once the connection is good, Click inside the query section, and add a space in the end (*this will re-enable the 'Save' option*) allowing for the flow activity to connect back to 'mysql connection', this time without an error. Then, Save and Close.

9.  Observe the error on the next 2 activities which need to be completed on the flow .  These 2 activities are connected to Auto-approve  “Waive Shipment flow” residing in “LiveApps” section of TCI platform.

Click  > Create Shipment Waiver Case and fill-in Application & Case Creator Field to connect to the “Business Process flow”.
*Note: The was the business app that was Activated via email and published earlier.*

Select Stop Testing and Cancel to exit out.


### Summary
In this exercise you imported an application and extended by reusing **Shipment Waiver API**.   You performed a local test to make sure your process app is able to connect to all distinct systems and is ready to be pushed further and be available for wider usage.
