## Configure the Endpoints in API Definition for the Published Application

Click on the shipmentWaiverAPI to manage aspects of the API before exposing it.

The details about the endpoint and how to access it are displayed in the next step.

We will dive into the various options available to manage the API Definition itself as we go along.

However, let’s dive deeper into the endpoints available in our ‘shipmentWaiverAPI’ first. The ‘shipmentwaiver’ application that was configured in TCI has one endpoint as part of the ‘shipmentWaiverAPI’ definition.
Copy the public endpoint from your screen and paste it into a text file as we will be using this later.
Then click on the Edit option.

There are various action’s the administrator can perform on the API Definition *(in this case, the ‘shipmentwaiver’ app which is inside the ‘shipmentWaiverAPI’ definition)*, in the ‘Edit’ which includes: changing the Public Endpoint, Adding Security options etc.

Under ‘Domains & Traffic Routing’, you can change how the external URL can be modified.

The public endpoint URL usually takes care of the API versioning as well as creating a user readable API URI.
We will change the Public Endpoint Address from the default view (harder to read) to a user readable format along with a version to the API.

So, the new URL looks like 'processOrder/v1/shipmentwaiver'.
Also, make a note of the 'http' and the 'https' protocols

As an example, in Macy’s Catalog, the URL for the ‘Product Detail’ is user readable and they manage their catalog versions to keep developers informed of underlying changes.

Under ‘Key & Method Detection’, you can validate and expand the various options available for interactions with the exposed method and choice of the Authentication Type.
For this workshop, we will keep it as API Key . However, take note of the 'Key Field Identifier' that was defined as 'api_key'. This will be a parameter entry when we test from an application like Postman.
![MASHDD1](/images/mashdd1/8.png).

This means if you put this field as 'apikey'(*without the '_'*) or as 'api-key'(*'-' instead of '_'*) , **you will need to change the parameter correspondingly to 'apikey' or 'api-key'** when submitting the request externally. In other words, match the external request to the one you provide here.

In ‘More Settings’ you also have options, including ‘Allow calls having no API Key’

As an administrator of the API endpoint, you can define how the endpoint should be protected and exposed at a granular level.
With the configuration of the endpoint of the ‘shipmentwaiver’ application complete, let's go back to the ‘API Endpoints’

## Configure the Security Settings on the API Definition
![MASHDD1](/images/mashdd1/11.png)

Depending on the requirements of your organization, you can enable ‘OAuth 2.0’ and adjust the different token options.
![MASHDD1](/images/mashdd1/12.png)
For this workshop, we will leave it as Disabled.

## Enable the Interactive Documentation Access Control on the API Definition
