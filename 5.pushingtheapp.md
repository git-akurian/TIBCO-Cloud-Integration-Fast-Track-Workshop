So to Summarize ,

a) We created a shipment waiver spec , and ran mock tests
b) Then we saw how to create a shipment Waiver app from spec and configure activities including creating a connection to CRM DB.
c) We imported a supporting app and exposed it to Cloud mesh . Also activated a low-code business app.
d) We then imported read-made app and wired the supporting  app using cloud mesh and corrected other activities for the flow.
e) Finally, We pushed it for deployment and tested the endpoints.

Now, Let's take a quick look at the unified & immersive experience to manage your Integrations Apps .
