# Creating a Mock  Application from the API Specification
Once an API spec is created, we can create an application to implement the spec. To follow best practices, create a mock application. This way, you can call the mock application, and ensure that it works as expected.

*In other words, fake the app before you start to make the app.*

A mock application allows developers and business analysts to agree on the functionality of the intended API.
Architects and developers can get a head start on their work by leveraging the Mock API well before the implemented API goes into production and receive/provide feedback and changes earlier in the API development lifecycle. TCI supports continuous planning, development, and testing.

## Create the Mock App
In order to create our Mock Application, click on the 3 dots to the right of the API Specification and select Create Mock Application as shown below:

Accept the defaults as shown below and click create:

## Test the Mock App
Once the application has been created and scaled, click on the endpoint and test it as shown below:
<img src="/images/mockapp/3.png" alt="Close Prompt" width=850/>

Scroll down to the sample payload and click try it out:

Notice the successful return code and sample data. Your Mock app is ready for testing by your developers:

## Summary
Creating Mock Apps is as simple as a mouse click within TIBCO Cloud Integration.  In this section, we leveraged the API that was created, generated and deployed a mock application to the cloud and tested the API end point.

In the next section, we will implement the full back end microservice using a web based editor inside TCI to create an Application based on this agreed upon and mock tested API.
