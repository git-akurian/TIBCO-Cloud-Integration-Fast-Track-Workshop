Click on ‘StandardPlan’ to apply more fine grained options.
*Note: This plan was created from the TCI wizard when we published the application.*

Let’s look at the different options under ‘Plan’:

In the following step, under **Plan Designer**, we have the option to add multiple API Definitions and select the Endpoint Definitions.

This allows the same API Definition to be part of multiple plans, Furthermore the same plan can also have multiple API Definitions.
One reason for other plans to be created is to service the same API for different payment types.
For e.g. a "Gold Plan" can be created which has a higher throttle limit compared to the default plan that regular customers would use.
We can also Activate/Inactivate plans in a very simple way.

Self-Service Key Provisioning is enabled for the user to activate access

Rate Limits is an important option that defines how the API endpoint is throttled and quota limits are established.

You can increase the throttle from 2 to 5.

Finally, enable access to ‘Everyone’ for this plan for our testing purposes.
